## About the Demo Datasets

We provide three process models and three event logs to showcase the applicability of SOPA and SimuBridge:a  hiring process in a university, a logistics process, and a pizza delivery process. For each, you can either discover simulation scenarios from the event logs, or create them manually from the respective process model. Then, try out to configure different cost variants using the abstract and concrete cost drivers present in the data set. Assume that one abstract cost driver is relevant for one specific activity of each process. What happens when you:

- change the concretization of abstract into concrete cost drivers as defined by the environmental cost variants?
- change simulation parameters of the process --- how does executing the process differently change its environmental impact?
- change concrete cost drivers and simulation parameters at the same time --- how does the environmental impact change when process behaviour is influenced by concrete cost drivers?

## LCA Data

The LCA data we provide for demonstration purposes, to be used with openLCA, is based on the European reference Life Cycle Database of the Joint Research Center [(see here)](https://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ELCD3/). The dataset, taken from [openLCA](https://nexus.openlca.org/database/ELCD) can be used free of charge and distributed to third parties.

We stress that the dataset with its product systems is illustrative only. Because we are unable (due to license restrictions) to share data derived from other databases, the demo dataset does not necessarily match to the scenarios and business processes we use in the demo. Further, the product systems were modelled in a very simplistic and abstract fashion. However, they still showcase how experts may use openLCA in combination with SimuBridge to assess business processes for their environmental impact.
